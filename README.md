# QuickSand-Model

Project Overview:

Design Choices:

    Model:
    - What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?
    - What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?

    Visualization:
    - How should we understand an instance of your model and what your visualization shows (whether custom or default)?

Signatures:

Predicates:

Testing:

Reflection:
    - Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?
